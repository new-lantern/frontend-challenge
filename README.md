# New Lantern Frontend Challenge

## Background

The New Lantern PACS consists of several components working together to provide a seamless workflow for Radiologists reading and dictating cases. For this challenge, there are three components: a dashboard, a worklist, and a reporter.

- The **Dashboard** is the landing page for the New Lantern PACS.
- The **Worklist** is where Radiologists can view and manage their cases.
- The **Reporter** is where Radiologists can dictate their cases.

Radiologists will have **each of these pages open in separate tabs/windows** wtih a multi-monitor setup.

## Problem

Radiologists often have a microphone connected to our app that allows them to dictate their cases in our reporter. The microphone often has a button that toggles the microphone on and off. This is represented by a simple button on the reporter page.

The issue is Radiologists aren't always looking at the reporter page, yet they may want to know if their microphone is on or off. On the other pages, you can see a badge that will display the status of the microphone.

## Task

Open the pages in separate tabs/windows and have the reporter page open in one tab/window.

Figure out a way to communicate if the microphone is on of off across windows/tabs.
